# Matplotlib Plotting

# # Solution 1 - Draw a line in a diagram from position to position
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

xpoints = np.array([1, 8])
ypoints = np.array([3, 10])

plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)
plt.show()



# # Solution 2 - Draw two points in the diagram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

xpoints = np.array([1, 8])
ypoints = np.array([3, 10])

plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints, 'o')
plt.show()



# # Solution 3 - Draw a line in a diagram from position to position
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

xpoints = np.array([1, 2, 6, 8])
ypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])

plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)

# Solution 4 - Plotting without x-points
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

ypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10, 5, 7])

plt.plot(ypoints)
plt.show()
