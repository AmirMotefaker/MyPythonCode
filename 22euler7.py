# Problem 7

# 10001st prime

# By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
# What is the 10 001st prime number?

# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1 + 2 + 3 + .... + 10)**2 = 55*55 = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is:
# 3025 - 385 = 2640
