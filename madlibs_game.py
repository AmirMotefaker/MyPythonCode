# Mad Libs Game

# Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game.

# Example:
# We start with a story, containing several blanked out words. Hereâ€™s a basic example:
# Rumble in the  _______.
# We then prompt the user to fill in the gaps, in this case, with a noun or place. We might end up with something like this:
# Rumble in the Toilet.


# Solution 1 - simple
